# zprop

----

**zprop** is a library that contains a class for writing and reading property files. The class has enough operators to store or obtain some value in the data type that corresponds to it.

The library only has two source code files, **Properties.hpp** and **Properties.cpp**. Those files are added directly to the project and compiled as part of the project it is being used in, this means you won't have to worry about linking to a static or dynamic link library.
